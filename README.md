## Introduction

**Rust Blockchain Project** is a high-performance, decentralized public blockchain written in Rust. It leverages Rust's memory safety and performance capabilities to deliver a secure and scalable blockchain platform.

## Features

- **Decentralized Consensus**: Implements a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, ensuring a secure and energy-efficient network.
- **Smart Contracts**: Supports smart contracts using WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing developers to write contracts in multiple languages.
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for high transactions per second (TPS), suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing blockchain ecosystems, enabling cross-chain communication.
- **Security**: Built with Rust to ensure memory safety and prevent common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
